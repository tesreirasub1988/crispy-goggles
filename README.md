### Step 10: Importance of Data Security and Backup


Before you start trading, it’s vital to address your data security. Use strong, unique passwords for your TradingView account and consider enabling two-factor authentication if available. Additionally, always back up your trading data to prevent loss in case of system failure or compromise.
